React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) - One of the most useful features offered by
webpack. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the
need for a full refresh. This page focuses on implementation while the
concepts page gives more details on how it works and why it's useful.

NOTE: HMR is not intended for use in production, meaning it should only be
used in development. See the building for production guide for more
information.

Dependencies List:
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
