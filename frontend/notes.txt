In React, the public folder contains static files such as
index.html, javascript library files, images, and other assets, etc. which 
you don’t want to be processed by Webpack. Files in this folder are copied 
and pasted as they are directly into the build folder. Files inside the 
`public` folder can only be referenced from the HTML.

Webpack - A powerful, open-source JavaScript module bundler. Essentially, it
takes all the different pieces of your web application—JavaScript, CSS,
images, and more—and packages them into files that can be efficiently used by
a web browser.   

Module Bundling - Modern web applications are often built using many separate
JavaScript files (modules). Webpack's primary job is to take these modules and
their dependencies and combine them into a smaller number of bundled files.
This reduces the number of HTTP requests a browser needs to make, which speeds
up page loading.


NOTE: The /logo.svg path indicates that Vite should look for the file in the root
of the project's static assets, which, in Vite's case, is the public folder.
