In React, the public folder contains static files such as
index.html, javascript library files, images, and other assets, etc. which 
you don’t want to be processed by Webpack. Files in this folder are copied 
and pasted as they are directly into the build folder. Files inside the 
`public` folder can only be referenced from the HTML.

Webpack - A powerful, open-source JavaScript module bundler. Essentially, it
takes all the different pieces of your web application—JavaScript, CSS,
images, and more—and packages them into files that can be efficiently used by
a web browser.   

Module Bundling - Modern web applications are often built using many separate
JavaScript files (modules). Webpack's primary job is to take these modules and
their dependencies and combine them into a smaller number of bundled files.
This reduces the number of HTTP requests a browser needs to make, which speeds
up page loading.


IMPORTANT: React is primarily used to build single-page applications (SPAs),
meaning a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically
updates its content based on user interaction, without needing to reload the
entire page each time.

React routing is for "navigating to different pages" on that SPA.

NOTE: Best Practice may vary on wether you want to build the whole project with
just React code OR a mix of React and static html pages. 
Do NOT go overkill with react for small-medium projects probably.

NOTE: The /logo.svg path indicates that Vite should look for the file in the root
of the project's static assets, which, in Vite's case, is the public folder.

docker exec -it frontend bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U myuser -d mydb
docker exec -it postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U myuser -d mydb

To Access PGAdmin CSV files one:

docker ps
docker exec -it magnumpimap-pgadmin-1 bash

NOTE: admin_pgadmin.com is the email account of pgadmin4!!

/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_pgadmin.com


Test if Postgresql is working command:

docker exec postgres pg_isready -t 90

To see ports being used by Docker Compose:
docker compose ps

Reason why it is not a good idea to store images in a database (use urls instead):

Example: If your table is named "locations", the correct query would be:

SELECT * FROM public.locations;
